High Availability
Alertmanager's high availability is in production use at many companies and is enabled by default.

Important: Both UDP and TCP are needed in alertmanager 0.15 and higher for the cluster to work.

If you are using a firewall, make sure to whitelist the clustering port for both protocols.
If you are running in a container, make sure to expose the clustering port for both protocols.
To create a highly available cluster of the Alertmanager the instances need to be configured to communicate with each other. This is configured using the --cluster.* flags.

--cluster.listen-address string: cluster listen address (default "0.0.0.0:9094"; empty string disables HA mode)
--cluster.advertise-address string: cluster advertise address
--cluster.peer value: initial peers (repeat flag for each additional peer)
--cluster.peer-timeout value: peer timeout period (default "15s")
--cluster.gossip-interval value: cluster message propagation speed (default "200ms")
--cluster.pushpull-interval value: lower values will increase convergence speeds at expense of bandwidth (default "1m0s")
--cluster.settle-timeout value: maximum time to wait for cluster connections to settle before evaluating notifications.
--cluster.tcp-timeout value: timeout value for tcp connections, reads and writes (default "10s")
--cluster.probe-timeout value: time to wait for ack before marking node unhealthy (default "500ms")
--cluster.probe-interval value: interval between random node probes (default "1s")
--cluster.reconnect-interval value: interval between attempting to reconnect to lost peers (default "10s")
--cluster.reconnect-timeout value: length of time to attempt to reconnect to a lost peer (default: "6h0m0s")
